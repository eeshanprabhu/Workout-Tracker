# Python Workout Tracker with AI Integration

Introducing a **revolutionary** Workout Tracker that redefines the fitness tracking experience.

**This innovative project uses natural language processing and artificial intelligence to allow users to log their workouts effortlessly**.

**Users can input workout details in natural language sentences, and the system intelligently extracts key information to populate a Google Sheet with date, time, exercise, duration, and calories burnt.**

**Key Features:**

1. **Natural Language Input:**
   - Users can describe their workouts in everyday language, making the tracking process intuitive and user-friendly.

2. **AI-Powered Data Extraction:**
   - The system utilizes artificial intelligence to analyze user input and extract relevant keywords, such as exercise type, duration, and intensity.

3. **Calorie Calculation:**
   - Integrated with the NutritionX API, the project automatically fetches data to calculate the calories burnt during each workout based on exercise type and duration.

4. **Dynamic Google Sheet Logging:**
   - The workout data is seamlessly logged into a Google Sheet with five columns: date, time, exercise, duration, and calories. This centralizes and organizes the user's fitness history.

5. **Adaptive Time Calculation:**
   - If a user enters only the distance covered during a run, the system dynamically calculates the average time required to complete that distance, offering a comprehensive view of their running performance.

**Advantages:**

1. **Effortless Logging:**
   - Simplifies workout tracking with natural language input, removing the need for manual data entry.

2. **Accurate Calorie Tracking:**
   - Utilizes nutrition data to provide accurate calorie estimates, enhancing the precision of fitness metrics.

3. **Dynamic Time Calculations:**
   - Adapts to user input variations, dynamically calculating missing workout parameters for a more comprehensive analysis.

4. **Centralized Workout History:**
   - Logs all workout details in a centralized Google Sheet for easy access and long-term trend analysis.

**This project helps the user transform their fitness journey with this Python Workout Tracker, seamlessly blending AI, natural language processing, and smart data management for an enhanced and personalized workout tracking experience.**
